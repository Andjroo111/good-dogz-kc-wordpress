# Learn Together, Grow Together

Coming Spring 2025!

Our group classes offer a structured environment for dogs to learn and practice skills around other dogs and people. Perfect for continuing education after private training or for dogs who need socialization practice in a controlled setting.

## Class Types
- **Basic Manners**: Essential commands and everyday behaviors
- **Advanced Skills**: Off-leash reliability and distance control
- **Specialty Focus**: Therapy dog preparation, trick training, and more

## Benefits of Group Learning
- **Real-World Distractions**: Practice focus in stimulating environments
- **Socialization Opportunities**: Positive interactions with other dogs and people
- **Peer Learning**: Dogs and owners learn from watching others
- **Community Building**: Connect with other dedicated dog owners

## Our Approach
Unlike large commercial classes, our groups are limited to 6 dogs to ensure:
- Individual attention
- Appropriate matching of dogs by temperament and skill level
- Safe, positive experiences for all participants
- Personalized feedback on your progress

## Pre-Requisites
To ensure a positive experience for everyone, dogs entering group classes should:
- Have completed basic training (private or previous group class)
- Be comfortable around other dogs at a distance
- Respond to basic cues in low-distraction environments
