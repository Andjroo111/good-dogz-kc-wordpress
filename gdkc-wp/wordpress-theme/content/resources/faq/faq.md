# Frequently Asked Questions

## Getting Started

### How do I know which training program is right for my dog?
We recommend starting with a free consultation where we can assess your dog's needs and your goals. Generally, puppies do best with our Puppy Program, dogs with specific behavioral challenges benefit from our Behavior Solutions, and dogs needing general manners training thrive in our standard In-Home Training program.

### Do you use positive reinforcement?
Yes! We use primarily positive reinforcement methods, focusing on rewarding desired behaviors. We also incorporate clear boundaries and management strategies to set your dog up for success. Our approach is balanced, science-based, and tailored to each individual dog.

### How soon will I see results?
Many clients see improvement after the very first session as they learn to communicate more effectively with their dog. More significant behavior changes typically develop over 2-4 weeks of consistent practice. Complex behavioral issues may take longer, but you should notice gradual improvement throughout the process.

## Training Process

### What happens in a typical training session?
Each session lasts about an hour and includes:
- Review of progress since the last session
- Troubleshooting any challenges you've encountered
- Learning and practicing new skills
- Creating a homework plan for the coming week
- Answering any questions you have

### Do you train the dog or teach me to train my dog?
Both! We demonstrate techniques with your dog, then coach you through practicing them yourself. This approach ensures you develop the skills to maintain training long-term. We believe in empowering owners rather than creating dependency on a trainer.

### What if multiple family members handle the dog?
We strongly encourage all family members to participate in at least some training sessions. Consistency is crucial for success, so we'll help establish clear guidelines that everyone can follow.

## Logistics & Policies

### What areas do you serve?
We're based in the Northland (64118) and serve the entire Kansas City metro area. There are no additional travel fees for locations within a 30-minute drive. For areas beyond that radius, a travel fee may apply.

### What forms of payment do you accept?
We accept credit/debit cards, Venmo, PayPal, and cash. Payment is due at the time of service unless you've chosen a package plan, which can be paid in installments.

### What if I need to reschedule?
We understand life happens! We require 24-hour notice for rescheduling without a fee. Cancellations with less notice may incur a fee unless due to emergency circumstances.

### Do you offer any guarantees?
We guarantee our commitment to helping you and your dog succeed. While we can't guarantee specific results (as they depend on consistent practice between sessions), we do promise to provide additional support if you're not seeing progress as expected.

## Special Situations

### My dog has bitten someone. Can you still help?
Yes, we have experience working with dogs with bite histories. These cases require a thorough assessment to determine the appropriate approach. Safety protocols will be established, and we'll be transparent about what to expect.

### Can you help with service dog training?
We can help with the foundational obedience required for service dogs and some task training. For specialized service dog tasks, we may refer you to trainers with expertise in your specific needs.

### My dog is fearful/reactive/aggressive. Which program is best?
Dogs with these challenges typically benefit most from our Behavior Solutions program, which addresses the emotional components underlying these behaviors. We'll create a customized plan based on your dog's specific triggers and history.
